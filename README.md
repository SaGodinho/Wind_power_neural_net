# Wind Power Neural Network

### Brief data analysis on EU Wind Energy Potential - 30 years of records.

The first dataset consists of wind energy potential values generated per hour in several european countries (29) for a 30 year time period from 1986 to 2015.
The second one is similar, but for different stations within the 29 countries (a total of 255).

The purpose of this project is to:
 * perform some data cleaning, make it a bit more digestible;
 * exploratory analysis, checkout some patterns in the data;
 * selected a country to simplify more detailed analysis;
 * create a recurrent neural network for time series value predicton.
